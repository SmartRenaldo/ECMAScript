You don’t really need me, do you?

Oh, you enjoy being with me.
You enjoy kissing me.
You enjoy having me at your side.
You enjoy playing the games that lovers play.
Perhaps you love me.
But you don’t really need me, do you?
What I mean is
you don’t lie awake at night thinking of me
you don’t leave your homework unfinished because
your mind is tormented by the thought of Lucius
you don’t go to sleep at night wishing my arms were around you.
