You will say it was quite unintentional,
this leaving the building without saying good-bye.
(“Can’t I depart, just once,
thinking only of daisies and chocolate pudding?…”)

There are in this world enchanters and enchantees.
It’s only the latter whose hearts are chained to heavy

    stones,
who could no more leave a room, forgetting you,
than they could, for several minutes, forget to breathe.

How lightly a goddess walks the earth,
evoking smiles in everyone,
but, still, you break our hearts–
like tigers stepping on sparrows’ eggs,
like a deer, walking silently through a strand of spiders’ silk,
taut between trees,
you break our hearts.
